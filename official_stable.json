You can use \"Import/Refresh Certificate from AltStore/SideStore\" button to setup JIT-Less mode.\r \nThis version of LiveContainer focuses on quality-of-life improvements, new features such as app sorting and enhanced multitasking, as well as various bug fixes.\r \nNew Features\r \nNew Icon\r\n1. LiveContainer/LiveContainer2 now has a new HD icon and supports dark and tinted modes. By @m1337v.\r \nMultitasking\r\n1. A dock has been added for multitasking mode. The dock can be hidden by dragging it to the edge of the screen, and collapsed by tapping the collapse button. You can also resize the dock in the settings. By @boa-z.\r\n2. In windowed multitasking mode, you can now maximize or minimize windows using buttons on the new window bar. By @boa-z.\r\n3. When maximized, the window will occupy the safe area. Additionally, if the dock is collapsed, the entire window bar will be hidden, allowing the app to take up the full screen.\r\n4. You can now place the window bar at the bottom of the window.\r\n5. Windows will now automatically resize when the device is rotated.\r\n6. You can now choose whether to automatically exit Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode when returning to LiveContainer. This option is available in the LiveContainer settings.\r \nApp Management\r\n1. You can now double-tap an app to quickly open its settings. By @m1337v.\r\n2. Apps can now be sorted by name (A–Z, Z–A), last opened date, installation date, or a custom order, allowing you to arrange them however you like. By @boa-z and @m1337v.\r\n3. You can now view an app's installation date and last launch date in its settings.\r \n[EXPERIMENTAL] Built-in SideStore\r\nThis experimental feature combines both LiveContainer and SideStore into a single app, saving one app slot for other standalone apps. You can try it out by downloading \"LiveContainer+SideStore.ipa\". Currently, SideStore itself, the refresh shortcut, and the widget are functional. See here for all changes made to original SideStore https://github.com/hugeBlack/SideStore/tree/LiveContainerSupport\r \n> [!Note]\r\n> LiveProcess is required to use the refresh shortcut.\r\n> It has been reported that the built-in SideStore cannot determine the device UDID if the standalone SideStore is running in the background. If you encounter this issue, please terminate the standalone SideStore.\r \nImprovements\r \nApp Switching Between LiveContainer/LiveContainer2/LiveProcess\r\nWe’ve implemented a new method to directly check whether LiveContainer or LiveContainer2 is running, enabling more accurate detection of running apps. In this version, LiveContainer will automatically switch to a running app or launch an app using an idle LiveContainer.\r \nUserDefaults/Preferences\r\nWe've adopted a new UserDefaults/Preferences hook that is more efficient and capable of redirecting more preference reads/writes to the app’s container.\r \nLanguage Switching\r\nWe’ve introduced a new language switching mechanism that now also applies to LiveProcess without affecting LiveContainer’s own language settings.\r \nBug Fixes\r\n1. Fixed an issue where some apps displayed a black screen in versions 3.5.0/3.5.1. Fixes 543, 594.\r\n2. Fixed an issue where some apps bypassed \"SecItem*\" hooks using \"dlsym\". Fix 339.\r\n3. Fixed issues with signing and patching apps when the app's main executable header was nearly full, by skipping certain patches. Fixes 606, 608.\r\n4. Fixed physical keyboard input not working in multitasking mode. Fix 524.\r\n5. Fixed a crash caused by receiving malformed OCSP responses. Fix 617.\r\n6. Fixed a crash caused by signals being converted to SIGKILL when TPRO switched to read-only mode. TPRO is now switched to read-only only after overwriting the main executable path. Fixes 310, 519.\r\n7. Fixed an issue where some apps couldn’t store UserDefaults by implementing a new UserDefaults hook. Fix 633.\r\n8. Fixed a crash in some apps due to symbol name conflicts with system symbols on iOS 26, by preloading affected libraries. Fix 667.\r\n9. We adopted a new method to mitigate an issue where some apps were being killed in the background with code 0xdead10cc.\r \nRemoved Features\r\n1. Store patching: This has been removed. Please use the \"Import Certificate from SideStore/AltStore\" button instead.\r\n2. Fix black screen: This is no longer needed, as the underlying issue has been resolved.\r\n3. Retrieve data from LiveProcess: This feature has been removed since we can now accurately detect whether LiveProcess is running.\r \n\r\nCredits\r\nThanks @CelloSerenity @a1exsDev @bachig26 for fixing typo/building script/repo files.\r \nSpecial thanks to the following contributors for continuing to update translations:\r\n• Traditional Chinese — Jack Black  \r\n• Italian — @Checkm8ra1n  \r\n• Turkish — @sekertr  \r\n• Vietnamese — @khanhduytran0  \r\n• Portuguese — @DaniTrox  \r\n• Arabic — dlshad2  \r\n• French — @p-sage  \r\n• German — @BeityBytes  \r\n• Japanese — @naolad  \r\n• Swedish — @se2crid",

This update brings powerful new features like multitasking and better ADP certificate support, along with several bug fixes, improvements, and new language translations.\r \nMultitasking\r\nOne of LiveContainer’s main limitations has been the inability to open more than one app at a time. Our new multitasking feature addresses that.\r \nYou can now launch multiple apps simultaneously in in-app virtual windows. These windows can be resized, scaled, and even displayed using the native Picture-in-Picture (PiP) feature. On iPads, apps can run in native window mode, displaying each app in a separate system window.\r \nAnd if you wish, you can choose to run apps in multitasking mode by default in settings.\r \nTo use multitasking:\r\n1. Convert the app you want to multitask into a shared app.\r\n2. Hold its banner and tap \"Multitask\".\r \n>[!Note]\r\n>1. To use multitasking, ensure you select \"Keep Extension\" when installing via SideStore/AltStore.  \r\n>2. Most common apps are compatible, but some may have issues.  \r\n>3. If you want to enable JIT for multitasked apps, you’ll need a JIT enabler that supports attaching by PID — coming soon in StikDebug.\r \nADP Certificate Support\r\nLiveContainer now officially supports ADP development certificates. Thanks to PR 537 by @SoY0ung, LiveContainer uses the app group included in your \".mobileprovision\" file, rather than hard-coded SideStore/AltStore app groups. This unlocks multitasking and other features.\r \n>[!Note]\r\n>1. Only development certificates are supported.  \r\n>2. To use multitasking, your \".mobileprovision\" must contain at least one app group. \r\n>3. To enable keychain separation, LiveContainer must be signed with all 128 required keychain access groups.  \r\n>4. We recommend changing LiveContainer's bundle ID to match the \"application-identifier\" in your \".mobileprovision\".\r \niOS 26 Liquid Glass Support\r\nAlthough LiveContainer is currently built with iOS 18.2 SDK, we include an option to enable Liquid Glass for LiveContainer's UI if you have upgraded to iOS 26. You can find this option in iOS Settings-> Apps -> LiveContainer -> enable Liquid Glass.\r \nImprovements\r\n• Optimized app launching process for faster startup:\r\n  - No longer moves shared app data to a private folder.\r\n  - Uses a new method to override the main executable path, avoiding SIGSEGV signal handlers.\r\n  - Removed app lock and use container lock only.\r\n• Added \".tipa\" support (467). Note: this allows installing \".tipa\" files, but does not mean the app will run properly without correct entitlements.\r\n• You can now search for apps in the app list.\r\n• Renamed StikJIT (Standalone) to StikDebug.\r \nBug Fixes\r\n• Fixed 200 by directly setting \"dyld.config.process.mainExecutablePath\" to app's real main executable path, ensuring \"_NSGetExecutablePath\" returns the correct value.\r\n• Fixed 326 by correcting an error in \"Info.plist\". Note: HealthKit entitlements are still required to access health data.\r\n• Alleviate 423 by avoiding dyld library validation bypass on signed apps, which otherwise prevents apps that requires JIT from executing JIT pages on A15+\r\n• Fixed 478 by moving the JIT enabling window to \"LCAppListView\".\r\n• Fixed 476 by updating ZSign.\r\n• Fixed 497 by resolving an issue in dyld library validation bypass.\r\n• Fixed iOS 16.2 (495) and iOS 18.4+ on iPad 7 (531).\r\n• Fixed 518 by sending KVO notifications when UsedDefaults is changed.\r\n• Fixed 582 by invalidating duplicate library load commands.\r \nDeprecated Features\r\nSideStore/AltStore Patching\r\nWith SideStore 0.6.2-20250420.25 and AltStore 2.2.1 both supporting certificate export, patching these stores is no longer necessary. This feature is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.\r \nTranslations\r\nThanks to our community translators, LiveContainer now supports:\r \n• Traditional Chinese — Jack Black  \r\n• Italian — @Checkm8ra1n  \r\n• Turkish — @sekertr  \r\n• Vietnamese — @khanhduytran0  \r\n• Portuguese — @DaniTrox  \r \nSpecial thanks to the following contributors for continuing to update translations:\r\n• Arabic — dlshad2  \r\n• French — @p-sage  \r\n• German — @BeityBytes  \r\n• Japanese — @naolad  \r\n• Swedish — @se2crid\r \nCredits\r\nShout out to @khanhduytran0 for doing a lot of research under the hood which made the multitasking feature possible! \r\nGreat thanks to @neoarz for providing us certificates so we can test support for ADP certificate!",

Fortunately we have developed the \"Spoof SDK Version\" feature, forcing system libraries to operate in the SDK version the app is built with. You can enable \"Spoof SDK Version\".\r \n\r\nNew Features\r\n1. New Re-Sign Strategy\r\nInstead of keeping track of expiration date, LiveContainer now directly ask iOS to determine whether the code signature is valid, which significantly decreases app re-sign rate. For now your apps will be re-signed only if their code signature is invalid, which probably happens when your certificate is expired (usually takes a year), or is revoked (when you reinstall SideStore/AltStore).\r \n2. Support for StikJIT(StikDebug), SideStore JIT\r\n [StikJIT(StikDebug)](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikJIT) is the newest on-device JIT enabler powered by [idevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice). You can now install it both as a standalone app or install it inside LiveContainer. See 265 item 5.8 for more information.\r \nSideStore has recently switched its backend to idevice and added on-device JIT support. For now its JIT URL Scheme has not been implemented so you have to manually enable JIT for LiveContainer.\r \n3. Spoof SDK version\r\nSpoofing SDK version forces system libraries to operate in the SDK version the app is built with. This fix works surprisingly well so we decided to enable it by default for newly installed apps. This fixes some old apps crashing because of the new SDK. We also removed the \"Bypass AssertBarrierOnQueue\" fix since the root cause is SDK version.\r \nFix 421 422\r \n4. Support Import Certificate From SideStore\r\nWith [this SideStore pr](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/pull/959), we can now directly retrieve certificate from SideStore (0.6.2-20250420.25+) without the patch, thus simplifying the process of enabling JIT-Less mode.\r \n5. Game Mode Support\r\nWith the SDK version upgrade, LiveContainer now supports game mode. If you don't need it, you can turn it off in the control center. \r \nBug Fixes\r\n1. Fix a regression caused by NSBundle path fix. Fix 409\r\n2. Keep app's plugin folder in case some apps need files inside. Fix hugeBlack/LiveContainer43\r\n3. Add TPRO rw in overwrite exec path in case the executable path is TPRO protected. Fix 327\r\n4. Replace all \"withCheckedContinuation\" with \"withUnsafeContinuation\" to solve crash on iOS 18.0 beta. Fix 435\r\n5. Add file permission to solve some sign issues. Fix 448\r \nRemoved Features\r\nThe following features are removed because it's not useful in current version or constantly causing issues.\r\n1. AltSign: We drop AltSign support because it's constantly causing issues and it's relatively old.\r\n2. Bypass AssertBarrierOnQueue: It is replaced by \"Spoof SDK version\"\r\n3. Sign Only on Signature Expires: It's now useless as we directly determine if an app's code signature is valid by asking the system.\r \nTranslation\r\nLiveContainer is now translated into Arabic, Simplified Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese and Swedish\r\n• Arabic: translated by dlshad2\r\n• French: translated by @p-sage\r\n• German: translated by @BeityBytes\r\n• Japanese: translated by @naolad\r\n• Portuguese: translated by damn_the_daniel\r\n• Swedish: translated by @se2crid\r \nCredit\r\nShout out to @khanhduytran0 for doing a lot of research under the hood!\r \nOther\r\nLiveContainer is now migrated from a Theos project to a Xcode project, which simplifies the development and significantly decreased Github Actions build time (2 minutes now and around 10 minutes previously)",

(Please note that iOS may hide LiveContainer in the \"More\" section—simply tap \"More\" and scroll down to find it.)\r\nShare File to Guest Apps\r\nFiles can now be shared to guest apps when they are running through the share sheet.\r \nImplement 320\r \nJITStreamer-EB Support\r\n[JITStreamer-EB](https://jkcoxson.com/jitstreamer) is now available in LiveContainer. To use it:\r\n• Set it up first in JITStreamer-EB's website\r\n• Go to LiveContainer settings->JIT Enabler->Select JITStreamer-EB. You can leave the \"Address\" blank if you are using official server and it's default to \"http://[fd00::]:9172\".\r\n• Long press the app that needs JIT->Settings->enable Launch with JIT->Tap Run, LiveContainer will contact the server and enable JIT for that app.\r \n>[!Note]\r\nJIT is broken in iOS 18.4 Beta 1, please avoid this version.\r \n\"Entitlement File\" Section in JITLess Diagnose\r\nThe \"Entitlement File\" section is now available in the JITLess Diagnose page, making it easier and more accurate to diagnose issues with your JITLess setup.\r \nPersonal Certificate Support (Untestsed)\r\nLiveContainer can now be used without SideStore/AltStore if you import the certificate used to sign it. Please note that for LiveContainer to work correctly, some changes must be made to the bundle and entitlement:\r\n• The bundle ID must match the one in the .mobileprovision file without a prefix.\r\n• LiveContainer must be signed with the get-task-allow=true entitlement, meaning Enterprise certificates will not work.\r\n• To use the keychain separation feature, LiveContainer must be signed with the correct entitlement. Please refer to entitlements.xml for the required keychain access groups.\r \n\r\nYou can check these criteria in Settings->JITLess Diagnose->Entitlement File. All items except com.apple.security.application-groups should be green.\r \nImplement 54 64 231\r \nUp to 128 Containers Per App\r\nWith the release of SideStore 0.6.0, which fixes the entitlement issue with Keychain Access Groups, you can now create up to 128 containers for each app. Each container created in version 3.3.0 will be assigned a random Keychain Access Group to prevent crashes caused by Keychain Access Group collisions.\r \nHide LiveContainer\r\nTo bypass some app's injection detection, 3 following options are added to app-specific settings.\r\n• Hide LiveContainer from Dyld Api\r\n• Don't Inject TweakLoader\r\n• Don't Load TweakLoader\r \nFor most apps, enabling the first two options should be sufficient to bypass injection detection. However, please note that if TweakLoader is not loaded, some features (like app fast switching) may not be available.\r \nFix 146 338\r \nArchive Option when Installing 2nd LiveContainer\r\nYou can now archive the second LiveContainer instead of installing it directly, allowing you to customize it as needed.\r \nURL to Launch to LiveContainer's UI\r\nYou can now use \"livecontainer://livecontainer-launch?bundle-name=ui\"to launch to LiveContainer's UI\r \nBug Fixes\r\n• Fix 314: Frameworks in the tweaks folder are now signed and injected correctly.\r\n• Fix 318: Resolved an issue in fishhook that caused crashes when handling invalid \"symtab_index\".\r\n• Fix 332: Fixed a dyld issue where the wrong image was being used when dyld functions were hooked.\r\n• Fix 329: Insert \"LC_ID_DYLIB\" load command to resolve segment-related issues.\r\n• Fix 358 374: Dopamine's dyld patch is taken into account when bypassing dyld library validation.\r\n• Fix 381: LiveContainer can correctly close itself when it is hidden.\r\n• Fix 384: All settings are correctly copied when replacing app.\r\n• Fixed UI issues when the \"Button Shape\" accessibility setting was enabled.\r\n• Improved some previously confusing or misleading text.",

Downgrading after updating will result in the loss of all app-specific settings.

Please refer to the \"Black Screen Fix\" section below for more details.\r \nNew Features\r\nBlack Screen Fix\r\nThe Black Screen Fix is no longer applied automatically to prevent loading \"UIKit.framework\" before the app’s main executable is opened, which could cause symbol binding issues. You can enable it in Long press app -> Settings -> enable Fix Black Screen\r \nApp Group Isolation\r\nYou can now isolate app groups for different containers, allowing multiple accounts (e.g., in SideStore) to be signed in within separate containers. You can find files inside app group in container folder -> LCAppGroup\r \nYou can enable this feature by: Long press app -> Settings -> (Container name) -> enable Isolate App Group\r\nFix 279\r \nOpen URL Automatically\r\nYou can now automatically open an URL in current app without being prompted.\r\nImplement 285 \r \nIgnore Error During dlopen\r\nThis fixes errors like \"dlsym(xxxx, xxxx)\" caused by app's initializers calling dlsym with a non-existing symbol\r \nFix issues like 124\r \nBetter App Signature Check\r\nThe team ID used in app signing is now considered when determining if an app needs re-signing. This allows apps to be re-signed if they are transferred between LiveContainers installed by different Apple IDs.\r \nJIT-Less Mode Diagnose Page & LiveContainer Help\r\nA new JIT-Less Mode Diagnose Page helps new users quickly identify configuration issues. Problematic items are highlighted in red for easy troubleshooting.\r \nYou can see this page in Settings -> JIT-Less Mode Diagnose.\r\nYou can see LiveContainer help in Apps -> ? Button\r \nBug Fixes & Compatibility\r\nSeparate App-Specific Settings from Info.plist\r\nApp-Specific Settings is now saved in a different file to prevent app from crashing due to reading it.\r \nFix 277\r \nHook dlsym(RTLD_MAIN_ONLY,xxx)\r\nRedirect this call to the app's main executable instead of LiveContainer's to prevent issues.\r \nFix 124 130 140 221 225\r \nDon't Link against UIKit.framework\r\n*This solution is provided by LiveContainer*\r\n\"UIKit.framework\" is now not linked by LiveContainer's main executable to prevent symbol binding issues. However this will prevent the black screen fix to be automatically applied.\r \nFix 277 272 200 139\r \nApp Hiding Without Device Password\r\nApp hiding now works even if the device doesn’t have a password set.\r \nFix 281\r \n(Regression) Fix 2 Bugs in NSUserDefaultsHook in 3.1.0\r\nFix 276 291\r \nFix long press actions of last guest app remain\r\nFix 235\r \nFix Apps Unable to Open Their Own URL Schemes\r\nFix 44\r \nResolve Crash Loop with Blank \"Info.plist\"\r\nHandles cases where \"Info.plist\" is blank due to app corruption, which previously crashes LiveContainerSwiftUI.\r\nFix 293\r \nFix CallKit Unable to Initialize \r\nFix 258\r \nFix Crash when Patching Store\r\nThe cause of this issue is that LiveContainer cannot access App Group due to incorrect setup.",

You can switch signer in Settings and app-specific settings for one specific app.\r \nRe-Sign Only on Expiration\r\nLiveContainer now keeps track of the date of expiration of each app's code signature and only signs when its signature is expired. So re-signing happens less frequent than before.\r \nAutomatic Tweak Re-Sign\r\nLiveContainer now keeps track of the tweaks you added and re-signs it if it is changed or its code signature expires, which makes tweak development with LiveContainer more convenient.\r \nImplement 175.\r \nMultiple Container Support\r\nYou can now create up to 3 containers for each app, so you can log in multiple accounts in different containers(data folders).\r \nKeychains are now semi-separated between app containers. Note that keychains will be removed if you delete a container in LiveContainer.\r \nkeychains created in older version will remain untouched so you can continue using your apps like before. To use this feature, clean up your keychain in LiveContainer settings.\r \nThis feature, along with the following fix of NSUserDefault leak impelements 218 176.\r \nLanguage Selection for Each App\r\nYou can now choose an language for an app in app-specific settings.\r \nImplement 171\r \nApp Preferences\r\nYou can now modify app preferences in LiveContainer like in iOS Settings. To change app preferences, go to app-specific settings -> (container name) -> Container Preferences\r \nImplement 252\r \nForce Orientation Lock\r\nThis option can be used to solve some game having stretched/mal-functioning UI when launched in portrait mode\r \nImplement 251\r \nJITLess Support for Multiple SideStores\r\nIf you use Multiple SideStores with SparseRestore, you can now export the tweaked SideStore IPA and install it manually to enable JITLess mode.\r \nImplement 219\r \nBug Fixes\r\n• NSUserDefault Leak & Random Signing out: NSUserDefault(app preferences) are now *almost* separated and properly placed in app's data folder.
